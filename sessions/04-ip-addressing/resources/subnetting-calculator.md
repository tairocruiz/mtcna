## üìä Calculation Methods

### **Manual Calculation Process**
```
Step 1: Convert to Binary
- Convert IP address to binary
- Convert subnet mask to binary

Step 2: Perform AND Operation
- IP address AND subnet mask
- Result is network address

Step 3: Calculate Broadcast
- Network address + (2^host_bits - 1)
- All host bits set to 1

Step 4: Determine Host Range
- First host: Network address + 1
- Last host: Broadcast address - 1
- Number of hosts: 2^host_bits - 2
```

### **Shortcut Methods**
```
Magic Numbers:
/25 = 128, /26 = 64, /27 = 32
/28 = 16, /29 = 8, /30 = 4

Quick Subnet Ranges:
- Start with 0
- Increment by magic number
- Each increment is a new subnet

Example: /26 (magic number = 64)
Subnets: 0, 64, 128, 192
```

### **VLSM Calculation**
```
Process:
1. Sort requirements by size (largest first)
2. Allocate largest subnets first
3. Use smallest possible masks
4. Ensure no overlap
5. Document allocations

Example:
- 100 hosts: /25 (126 hosts)
- 50 hosts: /26 (62 hosts)
- 25 hosts: /27 (30 hosts)
- 10 hosts: /28 (14 hosts)
```

## üîç Calculator Validation

### **Verification Methods**
```
Cross-Reference:
- Use multiple calculators
- Compare results
- Verify with manual calculations
- Check against known examples

Common Checks:
- Network address is correct
- Broadcast address is correct
- Host range is valid
- Number of hosts matches
- No overlapping subnets
```

### **Error Detection**
```
Common Errors:
- Incorrect binary conversion
- Wrong subnet mask
- Invalid host calculations
- Overlapping subnets
- Incorrect CIDR notation

Validation Steps:
- Verify input format
- Check calculation logic
- Confirm output format
- Test edge cases

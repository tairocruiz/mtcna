# VLSM and Advanced Subnetting

## üéØ Overview
Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) allows different subnets to have different subnet masks, enabling more efficient use of IP address space. This advanced subnetting technique is essential for modern network design.

## üìã What is VLSM?

### Definition
VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking) is a technique that allows different subnets within the same network to have different subnet masks, enabling optimal use of IP address space.

### Purpose
```
Address Efficiency:
- Minimize IP address waste
- Match subnet size to actual needs
- Support hierarchical addressing
- Enable route summarization

Network Design:
- Optimize network performance
- Reduce broadcast domains
- Improve security segmentation
- Support complex topologies
```

### VLSM vs Fixed-Length Subnetting
```
Fixed-Length Subnetting:
- All subnets have same mask
- Simple but inefficient
- Wastes IP addresses
- Limited flexibility

VLSM:
- Different masks per subnet
- Efficient address usage
- Complex but flexible
- Supports various network sizes
```

## üî¢ VLSM Calculation Process

### Step 1: Analyze Requirements
```
Identify:
- Number of hosts per subnet
- Network hierarchy
- Growth requirements
- Routing considerations
```

### Step 2: Sort Subnets by Size
```
Order subnets from largest to smallest
Example:
- Subnet A: 100 hosts
- Subnet B: 50 hosts
- Subnet C: 25 hosts
- Subnet D: 10 hosts
```

### Step 3: Allocate Subnets
```
Start with largest subnet
Use smallest possible mask for each
Ensure no overlap between subnets
Document each allocation
```

### Step 4: Verify Allocation
```
Check:
- All requirements met
- No overlapping subnets
- Efficient address usage
- Room for growth
```

Example: 192.168.1.0/26 (subnet zero)
```

### All-Ones Subnet
```
Definition: Last subnet in a network (all subnet bits = 1)
Usage: Traditionally avoided, now commonly used
Example: 192.168.1.192/26 (all-ones subnet)
```

### Discontiguous Subnets
```
Definition: Subnets that are not adjacent in address space

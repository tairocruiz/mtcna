# Subnetting Concepts and Calculations

## üéØ Overview
Subnetting is the process of dividing a network into smaller, more manageable networks. Understanding subnetting is crucial for network design, IP address allocation, and efficient network management.

## üìã What is Subnetting?

### Definition
Subnetting is the practice of dividing a single network into multiple smaller networks (subnets) by borrowing bits from the host portion of an IP address to create additional network bits.

### Purpose
```
Network Management:
- Improve network performance
- Reduce broadcast domains
- Enhance security through segmentation
- Simplify troubleshooting

IP Address Conservation:
- Efficient use of IP addresses
- Reduce address waste
- Support hierarchical addressing
- Enable route summarization
```

## üî¢ Subnet Mask Fundamentals

### What is a Subnet Mask?
```
Definition: 32-bit number that identifies which portion of an IP address belongs to the network and which belongs to the host
Purpose: Determines the network address and host range
Format: Same as IP address (dotted decimal notation)
Example: 255.255.255.0 for a /24 network
```

### Subnet Mask Structure
```
Binary Representation:
Network Bits: 1s (left side)
Host Bits: 0s (right side)

Example - /24 subnet mask:
11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
255.255.255.0
```

### Common Subnet Masks
```
/8   = 255.0.0.0       (Class A default)
/16  = 255.255.0.0     (Class B default)
/24  = 255.255.255.0   (Class C default)
/25  = 255.255.255.128 (128 hosts)
/26  = 255.255.255.192 (64 hosts)
/27  = 255.255.255.224 (32 hosts)
/28  = 255.255.255.240 (16 hosts)
/29  = 255.255.255.248 (8 hosts)
/30  = 255.255.255.252 (4 hosts)
/31  = 255.255.255.254 (2 hosts)
/32  = 255.255.255.255 (1 host)
```

## üèóÔ∏è Subnetting Components

### Network Address
```
Definition: First address in a subnet (all host bits = 0)
Purpose: Identifies the subnet
Calculation: IP address AND subnet mask
Example: 192.168.1.0/24
```

### Broadcast Address
```
Definition: Last address in a subnet (all host bits = 1)
Purpose: Sends traffic to all hosts in the subnet
Calculation: Network address + (2^host_bits - 1)
Example: 192.168.1.255/24
```

### Valid Host Range
```
Definition: Usable IP addresses in a subnet
Range: Network address + 1 to Broadcast address - 1
Example: 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254
```

### Number of Hosts
```
Formula: 2^host_bits - 2
Subtract 2: Network address and broadcast address
Example: /24 = 2^8 - 2 = 256 - 2 = 254 hosts
```

---

## üîÑ Subnetting Calculation Process

### Step 1: Determine Network Requirements
```
Identify:
- Number of subnets needed
- Hosts per subnet
- Network address range
- Growth requirements
```

### Step 2: Calculate Subnet Bits
```
Formula: 2^subnet_bits >= number_of_subnets
Example: Need 6 subnets
2^3 = 8 >= 6 (use 3 subnet bits)
```

### Step 3: Calculate Host Bits
```
Formula: Total bits - network bits - subnet bits = host bits
Example: 32 - 24 - 3 = 5 host bits
```

### Step 4: Determine Subnet Mask
```
Convert host bits to subnet mask
Example: 5 host bits = /27 = 255.255.255.224
```

### Step 5: Calculate Subnet Ranges
```
Network Address: Base + (subnet_number √ó subnet_size)
Broadcast Address: Network + (2^host_bits - 1)
Host Range: Network + 1 to Broadcast - 1
```

/26 = 255.255.255.192
/27 = 255.255.255.224
/28 = 255.255.255.240

/30 = 255.255.255.252
```

## üìà Subnetting Formulas

### Key Formulas
```
Number of Subnets: 2^subnet_bits
Number of Hosts: 2^host_bits - 2
Subnet Size: 2^host_bits
Network Address: IP AND subnet_mask
Broadcast Address: Network + (2^host_bits - 1)
First Host: Network + 1
Last Host: Broadcast - 1
```

### Magic Numbers
```
/25 = 128
/26 = 64
/27 = 32
/28 = 16
/29 = 8
/30 = 4
/31 = 2
/32 = 1
```

### Subnet Calculation Shortcut
```
Step 1: Find magic number (256 - last octet of subnet mask)
Step 2: Start with 0, increment by magic number
Step 3: Each increment is a new subnet

Example: /26 (255.255.255.192)
Magic number: 256 - 192 = 64
Subnets: 0, 64, 128, 192
```

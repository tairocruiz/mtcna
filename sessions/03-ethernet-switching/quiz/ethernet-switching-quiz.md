## üìã Answer Key

### **Multiple Choice Answers:**
1. B) Clock synchronization
2. A) First 6 bytes after SFD
3. B) 1500 bytes
4. C) Multicast
5. B) Manufacturer identifier
6. B) Store-and-forward
7. B) Map MAC addresses to ports
8. B) Switch
9. B) FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
10. C) ARP
11. B) Logical network segmentation
12. B) Trunk port
13. A) VLAN 1
14. B) Cut-through
15. B) Collision detection

### **Short Answer Sample Responses:**

#### **Question 16:**
**Collision Domain:** Area where collisions can occur. In traditional Ethernet, all devices on a shared medium (like a hub) are in the same collision domain. Switches create separate collision domains for each port.

**Broadcast Domain:** Area where broadcast frames are forwarded. All devices that receive broadcast frames are in the same broadcast domain. VLANs and routers create separate broadcast domains.

#### **Question 17:**
**Store-and-Forward:** Receives entire frame, checks for errors, then forwards. Advantages: Error detection, support for different speeds. Disadvantages: Higher latency, more processing.

**Cut-Through:** Reads destination address and starts forwarding immediately. Advantages: Lowest latency, fast processing. Disadvantages: No error filtering, bad frames forwarded.

**Fragment-Free:** Reads first 64 bytes (minimum frame size) before forwarding. Advantages: Fast forwarding, collision fragment filtering. Disadvantages: Limited error detection.

#### **Question 18:**
**FCS (Frame Check Sequence):** 4-byte field containing a CRC-32 checksum calculated over all fields except preamble and SFD. Used for error detection. If the calculated checksum doesn't match the received FCS, the frame is discarded.

#### **Question 19:**
Switch learns MAC addresses by examining the source MAC address of incoming frames. When a frame arrives on a port, the switch adds the source MAC address and port number to its address table. The table is used to forward future frames to the correct port. Entries age out after a specified time.

#### **Question 20:**
**Benefits of VLANs:**
- **Security:** Isolate traffic between different groups
- **Performance:** Reduce broadcast domains and improve network efficiency
- **Management:** Simplify network administration and troubleshooting
- **Flexibility:** Logical grouping independent of physical location
- **Scalability:** Easy to add/remove devices from VLANs

# Switching Concepts

## üéØ Overview
Network switches are fundamental devices in modern Ethernet networks. They provide intelligent packet forwarding, improve network performance, and enable network segmentation.

## üìã What is a Switch?

### Definition
A network switch is a Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) device that connects multiple devices on a network and uses MAC addresses to forward frames to the correct destination.

### Key Functions
- **Frame Forwarding:** Direct frames to specific destinations
- **MAC Address Learning:** Build and maintain address tables
- **Loop Prevention:** Prevent broadcast storms
- **VLAN Support:** Segment networks logically
- **Port Security:** Control access to network

## üîÑ How Switches Work

### Basic Operation
```
1. Frame Reception: Switch receives frame on ingress port
2. Address Learning: Updates MAC address table
3. Frame Forwarding: Forwards frame to appropriate port(s)
4. Table Maintenance: Manages address table entries
```

### MAC Address Table
```
Purpose: Maps MAC addresses to switch ports
Structure: MAC Address | Port | VLAN | Age
Learning: Automatic from received frames
Aging: Entries timeout after specified period
Capacity: Varies by switch model (8K-128K entries)
```

### Frame Forwarding Methods

#### **1. Store-and-Forward**
```
Process:
1. Receive entire frame
2. Check for errors (FCS validation)
3. Look up destination in MAC table
4. Forward frame to appropriate port(s)

Advantages:
- Error detection and filtering
- Support for different speeds
- Quality of service features

Disadvantages:
- Higher latency
- More processing required
```

#### **2. Cut-Through**
```
Process:
1. Read destination address
2. Start forwarding immediately
3. No error checking during forwarding

Advantages:
- Lower latency
- Faster processing

Disadvantages:
- No error filtering
- Bad frames forwarded
- Limited QoS support
```

#### **3. Fragment-Free**
```
Process:
1. Read first 64 bytes (minimum frame size)
2. Check for collision fragments
3. Forward if no errors detected

Advantages:
- Fast forwarding
- Collision fragment filtering
- Good balance of speed and error checking

Disadvantages:
- Limited error detection
- Some bad frames may be forwarded
```

## üîç Frame Forwarding Process

### Detailed Forwarding Steps

#### **Step 1: Frame Reception**
```
Port receives frame
Checks for errors (if store-and-forward)
Validates frame format
Extracts destination MAC address
```

#### **Step 2: Address Table Lookup**
```
Search MAC address table for destination
Check if address is known or unknown
Determine forwarding decision
Update source address in table
```

#### **Step 3: Forwarding Decision**
```
Known Unicast: Forward to specific port
Unknown Unicast: Flood to all ports (except source)
Multicast: Forward based on multicast table
Broadcast: Flood to all ports (except source)
```

#### **Step 4: Frame Transmission**
```
Queue frame for transmission
Apply QoS policies (if configured)
Transmit frame to destination port(s)
Update statistics counters
```

### Forwarding Examples

#### **Unicast Forwarding**
```
Source: Host A (MAC: 00:11:22:33:44:55) on Port 1
Destination: Host B (MAC: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF) on Port 3
Action: Forward frame only to Port 3
```

#### **Unknown Unicast Forwarding**
```
Source: Host A (MAC: 00:11:22:33:44:55) on Port 1
Destination: Unknown MAC address
Action: Flood frame to all ports except Port 1
```

#### **Broadcast Forwarding**
```
Source: Host A (MAC: 00:11:22:33:44:55) on Port 1
Destination: Broadcast address (FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF)
Action: Flood frame to all ports except Port 1
```

## üåê Network Domains

### Collision Domains
```
Definition: Area where collisions can occur
Traditional: Shared medium (hub, bus topology)
Modern: Each switch port is a separate collision domain
Elimination: Switches eliminate collisions
```

### Broadcast Domains
```
Definition: Area where broadcast frames are forwarded
Scope: All devices that receive broadcast frames
Segmentation: VLANs create separate broadcast domains
Control: Routers and Layer 3 switches segment broadcast domains
```

### VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks)
```
Purpose: Logical network segmentation
Benefits: Security, performance, management
Configuration: Port-based, MAC-based, protocol-based
Inter-VLAN Routing: Layer 3 devices required
```

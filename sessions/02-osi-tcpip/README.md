# Session 02: OSI Model and TCP/IP Stack

## 📚 Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you will be able to:
- Understand the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model and its seven layers
- Explain the TCP/IP protocol suite and its four layers
- Compare and contrast OSI vs TCP/IP models
- Identify protocols and their corresponding layers
- Understand data encapsulation and de-encapsulation processes

# Networking Fundamentals

## What is Computer Networking?

**Computer Networking** is the practice of connecting two or more computing devices together to share resources, exchange data, and communicate. Networks enable devices to work together, share information, and access shared resources like printers, files, and internet connections.

## Why Do We Need Networks?

### 1. **Resource Sharing**
- Share expensive hardware (printers, scanners, storage)
- Share software applications and licenses
- Share internet connections

### 2. **Communication**
- Email, instant messaging, video conferencing
- Voice over IP (VoIP) calls
- Social networking and collaboration

### 3. **Data Sharing and Storage**
- Centralized file storage and backup
- Database access and sharing
- Cloud storage and services

### 4. **Cost Efficiency**
- Reduced hardware costs through sharing
- Centralized management and maintenance
- Economies of scale

### 5. **Reliability and Redundancy**
- Backup systems and failover
- Distributed processing
- Load balancing

## Evolution of Networking

### 1960s-1970s: **Early Networks**
- ARPANET (predecessor to Internet)
- Mainframe terminals
- Point-to-point connections

### 1980s: **LAN Development**
- Ethernet standard (IEEE 802.3)
- Token Ring networks
- Personal computers networking

### 1990s: **Internet Explosion**
- World Wide Web
- TCP/IP becomes standard
- Commercial internet services

### 2000s-Present: **Modern Networking**
- Wireless networking (Wi-Fi)
- Mobile networks (3G, 4G, 5G)
- Cloud computing and virtualization
- Internet of Things (IoT)

## Key Networking Principles

### 1. **Connectivity**
Networks must provide reliable connections between devices.

### 2. **Scalability**
Networks should grow and adapt to changing needs.

### 3. **Security**
Networks must protect data and resources from unauthorized access.

### 4. **Performance**
Networks should provide adequate speed and reliability.

### 5. **Manageability**
Networks should be easy to configure, monitor, and troubleshoot.

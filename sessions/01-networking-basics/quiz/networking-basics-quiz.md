### Short Answer Sample Answers:

**11. Benefits of networking:**
- Resource sharing (printers, files, internet)
- Communication (email, messaging, video calls)
- Cost efficiency (shared resources, centralized management)

**12. Topology difference:**
- Physical Topology: How devices are physically connected with cables and hardware
- Logical Topology: How data flows through the network, regardless of physical connections

**13. Network media types:**
- Copper cables (Ethernet, coaxial)
- Fiber optic cables
- Wireless (radio waves, infrared)

**14. Cat 5e vs Cat 6 differences:**
- Cat 5e: 100 MHz bandwidth, up to 1 Gbps, 100 meters, affordable
- Cat 6: 250 MHz bandwidth, up to 1 Gbps (10 Gbps short distance), 100 meters, better crosstalk performance

**15. Crossover cable use cases:**
- Connecting two similar devices (PC to PC, switch to switch, router to router)
- Direct device-to-device connections without network infrastructure
- Legacy equipment that doesn't support auto-MDI/MDI-X
- When auto-negotiation fails between devices

**16. Rollover cable purpose:**
- Console connection to network devices for initial configuration
- Management access to routers, switches, firewalls
- Serial communication for device setup and troubleshooting
- Out-of-band management when network connectivity is not available

**17. Auto-MDI/MDI-X technology:**
- Modern devices automatically detect cable type and adjust pin configuration
- Devices can switch between MDI and MDI-X modes automatically
- Eliminates the need for crossover cables in most modern networks
- Uses test signals to determine optimal transmit/receive pair alignment

# Lab 01: Network Discovery

## üéØ Objective
Learn to identify and explore your local network using built-in operating system tools.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
- Computer with Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Network connection (wired or wireless)
- Basic command line knowledge

## üìã Lab Steps

### Step 1: Identify Your Network Interface
Discover your network adapters and their configuration.

#### Windows:
```cmd
ipconfig /all
```

#### macOS/Linux:
```bash
ifconfig
# or
ip addr show
```

**Questions:**
1. How many network interfaces do you have?
2. What is your IP address?
3. What is your subnet mask?
4. What is your default gateway?

### Step 2: Discover Network Neighbors
Find other devices on your local network.

#### Windows:
```cmd
arp -a
```

#### macOS/Linux:
```bash
arp -a
# or
ip neighbor show
```

**Questions:**
1. How many devices are visible in your ARP table?
2. Can you identify what types of devices they might be?

### Step 3: Test Network Connectivity
Test connectivity to various network destinations.

#### Ping Local Gateway:
```bash
ping [gateway-ip]
# Example: ping 192.168.1.1
```

#### Ping External Host:
```bash
ping google.com
ping 8.8.8.8
```

**Questions:**
1. What is the response time to your gateway?
2. What is the response time to Google?
3. What does this tell you about your network path?

### Step 4: Trace Network Path
Discover the path packets take to reach a destination.

#### Windows:
```cmd
tracert google.com
```

#### macOS/Linux:
```bash
traceroute google.com
```

**Questions:**
1. How many hops to reach Google?
2. Can you identify your ISP's routers?
3. Where do you see the highest latency?

### Step 5: Network Statistics
View network usage and statistics.

#### Windows:
```cmd
netstat -e
netstat -an
```

#### macOS/Linux:
```bash
netstat -i
netstat -an
```

**Questions:**
1. How much data has been transmitted/received?
2. What network connections are currently active?
3. Which ports are listening on your system?

## üîç Analysis Questions

1. **Network Type:** Based on your IP address, what type of network are you on? (Home, office, public Wi-Fi?)

2. **Network Size:** Estimate how many devices could be on your network based on the subnet mask.

3. **Performance:** Is your network performing well? What evidence supports your conclusion?

4. **Security:** What security concerns might exist based on what you discovered?

## üéì Learning Outcomes
